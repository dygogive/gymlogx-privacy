    <h1>Privacy Policy for GymLogX</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: December 29, 2025</strong></p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>GymLogX is a workout tracking and training planning application. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect (if any), how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>Current version:</strong> GymLogX currently does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. The app operates entirely offline.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Future optional features:</strong> Future versions may include optional features that, with your explicit consent, may collect limited data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Crash reporting:</strong> Anonymous crash and error reports to help improve app stability (e.g., via Firebase Crashlytics)</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud backup:</strong> Optional synchronization of your workout data with your Google Account for backup and multi-device access</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These features will always be optional and will require your explicit permission before activation. You will be clearly informed before any data is collected.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data you create in GymLogX is stored locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Workout programs and training blocks</li>
        <li>Exercises and their configurations</li>
        <li>Workout results (weight, reps, sets, time)</li>
        <li>Performance history and progress data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is stored using Android Room Database on your device.</p>
    
    <h2>Cloud Backup (Optional Future Feature)</h2>
    <p>Future versions may offer optional cloud backup functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can choose to sync your workout data with your Google Account</li>
        <li>This feature will be disabled by default and requires your explicit opt-in</li>
        <li>Backed up data will be stored in your personal Google Drive storage</li>
        <li>You can disable cloud backup at any time from app settings</li>
        <li>You can delete your cloud data at any time</li>
        <li>Cloud data is associated with your Google Account and protected by Google's security measures</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Backup and Export</h2>
    <p>You have full control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can manually export your entire training database to a JSON file</li>
        <li>Export files are stored on your device in a location you choose</li>
        <li>You can import previously exported data to restore your workout history</li>
        <li>Your data remains under your complete control at all times</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>GymLogX may require the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage/Files:</strong> To export your workout data to JSON files and import backup files from your device storage</li>
        <li><strong>Internet (future):</strong> Only if you enable optional cloud backup or crash reporting features</li>
        <li><strong>Google Account access (future):</strong> Only if you enable optional cloud backup to sync data with your Google Drive</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Permissions are only used for the purposes described. Optional features requiring internet access will always require your explicit consent.</p>
    
    <h2>Pre-loaded Content</h2>
    <p>GymLogX includes two sample workout programs for demonstration purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gym workout (standard equipment)</li>
        <li>Outdoor workout (minimal equipment)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> These sample programs are provided as examples to help you understand how to use the app. They are not personalized training plans. Before starting any exercise program, consult with a qualified healthcare provider or fitness professional. The developer assumes no responsibility for any injuries or health issues that may result from using these sample programs or any workout programs created within the app.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p><strong>Current version:</strong> GymLogX currently does not use any third-party services.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Future optional services:</strong> Future versions may include optional third-party services with your consent:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> For anonymous crash reporting to improve app stability. This service collects device information, crash logs, and performance data but does not collect personal information</li>
        <li><strong>Google Drive API:</strong> For optional cloud backup of your workout data to your personal Google Account</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services will only be used if you explicitly enable the corresponding features. You can review Google's privacy policies at:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Google Drive: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>What Data May Be Collected (Optional Features Only)</h2>
    <p>If you choose to enable optional features in future versions:</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>The current version of GymLogX does not include in-app purchases or subscription features. If such features are added in future versions, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly, and users will be notified of any changes before implementation.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>GymLogX is intended for users aged 13 and above. The app does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Since the current version stores all data locally on the device and does not connect to the internet, no personal information is collected from any users, including minors. If optional cloud features are enabled in the future, parental consent will be required for users under 13 in accordance with applicable laws.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Your workout data is stored securely:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Local data is stored in an encrypted database on your device</li>
        <li>If you enable cloud backup, your data is protected by Google's security measures</li>
        <li>Crash reports (if enabled) are anonymized and contain no personal information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We recommend:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regularly exporting your data as a backup</li>
        <li>Using your device's security features (screen lock, encryption)</li>
        <li>Keeping backup files in a secure location</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Local data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app. If you enable cloud backup:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cloud data is stored in your Google Drive as long as you keep it there</li>
        <li>You can delete cloud data at any time from your Google Drive or app settings</li>
        <li>Disabling cloud backup does not automatically delete previously backed up data from Google Drive</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can view all your data within the app at any time</li>
        <li><strong>Export:</strong> You can export all your data to a JSON file</li>
        <li><strong>Delete:</strong> You can delete individual workouts, exercises, or entire programs within the app</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud control:</strong> If you enable cloud backup, you can disable it and delete cloud data at any time</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> You can disable crash reporting at any time from app settings</li>
        <li><strong>Complete removal:</strong> Uninstalling the app will remove all locally stored data from your device</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app, new features, or legal requirements. When we make significant changes, we will notify you through the app or update the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Consent</h2>
    <p>By using GymLogX, you consent to this Privacy Policy. If future versions introduce optional features that collect data, you will be asked to provide explicit consent before those features are activated.</p>
    
    <h2>Medical Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>GymLogX is a workout tracking tool, not a medical device or personalized training service. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider before beginning any exercise program. The developer is not responsible for any injuries, health issues, or other consequences resulting from the use of this app.</p>
