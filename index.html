    <h1>Privacy Policy for GymLogX</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: January 3, 2026</strong></p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>GymLogX is a workout tracking and training planning application. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>GymLogX collects minimal data to improve app stability and user experience:</p>

        <li>Workout results (weight, reps, sets, time)</li>

    </ul>
    <p>This data is stored using Android Room Database on your device and remains under your complete control.</p>
    
    <h3>Automatically Collected Data (via Firebase)</h3>
    <p>To improve app stability and performance, we collect the following anonymous technical data through Google Firebase services:</p>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This data helps us identify and fix bugs to improve app stability. No personally identifiable information is collected.</p>
